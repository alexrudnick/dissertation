\chapter{Research Plan}

In the coming year, we have a large -- but finite -- number of tasks that we
would like to perform to carry out this dissertation work. What follows is a
rough, tentative list of the tasks, with their timeline.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Bring up initial versions of the Tahekami and Guampa websites in
  October 2013, in time for the LREC deadline. We will write an LREC paper
  about Guampa at least.
  \item Ongoing development of the data-collection websites should (ideally)
  largely be handled by open-source volunteers, from Indiana and Paraguay.
  \item Development of the various CL-WSD approaches will be ongoing and
  modular.
  \item Before the EACL short-paper deadline (January 2014), we should have
  packaged up a more modular CL-WSD system and integrated it into the SQUOIA
  system (Spanish-Quechua RBMT from Zurich) at least.
  \item Development of Terer√©, the SCFG-based hybrid system, will be ongoing,
  but hopefully it will be prototyped by the end of 2013 and useful by Spring
  semester 2014.
  \item Experiments and evaluation will be underway by Spring semester 2014.
  \item Dissertation writing will be ongoing, but hopefully finishing up by
  Summer 2014.
  \item Thesis Defense by September 2014.
\end{itemize}

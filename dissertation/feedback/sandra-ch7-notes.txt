This is the list of all notes that Sandra put on the pdf we sent out for
chapter 7.

[[ page 103 ]]
highlight "Our systems trained with multilingual evidence posted ..."
"I am gardenpathing here."
--> reworded! Ha, this is syntactically the same as "the horse raced past the
barn fell". Nice.

[[ page 104 ]]
"I would add that these are the five languages with the most resources, and not
related to the target languages. In other words, if this setup works, this is
reason to believe it would work for other target languages, too."
--> Great point. Added a bit about this.

[[ page 110 ]]
"I would like this example much earlier in the chapter. I think that would help
the reader understand the setup better."
--> moved the example to the beginning of the chapter

[[ page 112 ]]
"Can you raise the question whether it is better to have a large, out of domain
data set, or a small, in-domain one? Is that what you are comparing?"
--> That's it, yes! Added a note to make that more explicit.

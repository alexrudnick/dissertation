This is the list of all notes that Sandra put on the pdf we sent out for
chapter 6.

highlight "but these will be left to future work"
"for a thesis, it's better ty say they are outisde the scope of the thesis. the
thesis is supposed to be a finished piece of work, so you don't really want to
have loose ends."

[[ page 74 ]]
highlight "The dependency parses output by MaltParser are stored on disk in
CONLL-X format."
"Is that really relevant?"

[[ page 75 ]]
highlight "each token's immediate syntactic head"
"here an example of a dependency parse and the extracted features would help"

note: "can you give us a non-technical, big picture explanation of Brown
clustering first?"

[[ page 77 ]]

note: "this sounds like comparing europarl apples to wikipedia oranges. Would
it be a lot of work to also try a 2 million subset of wikipedia, ie same size
as europarl, but different domain?"

highlight "perhaps"
"this sound more like you are uncertain than you are considering different
possibilities, can you change this to "it is possible" or similar?

[[ page 82 ]]
highlight "but we will try them both"
"try may not be the best word here, that implies random choice"

[[ page 84 ]]
highlight "try out"

[[ page 86 ]]
highlight "try"

note: "what would be your hypotheses, how these different methods differ wrt
what they represent?"

[[ page 89 ]]
highlight "tried"
highlight "try"
highlight "tried"

highlight "following feature sets"
"why those?"

highlight "pyramid"
"what is that?"

[[ page 92 ]]
note: "it would help if you bolded the best results per language in the tables"

note: "what happens with europarl surface, window only? and with either corpus
+ lemma + window only?"

[[ page 96 ]]
highlight "beat"
"very colloquial"

[[ page 97 ]]
highlight "Probably something like doc2vec embeddings could be made to work
well in this setting, but more experimentation would be needed."
"You may want to delete this or rephrase it, no loose ends ... :) "

\label{chap:relatedwork}

In this chapter, I will review some of the recent related work, including
techniques for CL-WSD considered as a task on its own, the application of
classifiers to lexical selection in various machine translation architectures,
techniques used in recent runnings of the SemEval task on CL-WSD, and some
relevant approaches for word-sense disambiguation more broadly. The chipa
software and the work described in the rest of the dissertation draws heavily
from ideas described here; particular ideas will be highlighted as we get to
them.

\section{CL-WSD \emph{in vitro}}

Some of the previous work on CL-WSD has studied the CL-WSD task in isolation, 
without being embedded into a machine translation system as such.
It is sensible to explore CL-WSD on its own for several reasons. Firstly, even
if our motivation for developing CL-WSD is to improve machine translation
output, from an engineering perspective, we still want to get a sense of
how well the individual components of our pipeline are functioning.
Furthermore, if the MT pipeline is relying on a CL-WSD system to help it with
lexical selection, one expects that improved disambiguation accuracy will
result in better translations overall -- though of course in complex software,
unexpected interactions may occur.

Another motivation for studying CL-WSD on its own is that it provides us with
new data sets on which we can test supervised word-sense disambiguation
algorithms: word-aligned bitext from any language pair can be used to train and
test supervised WSD.

sense-annotated data is even harder to come by than sentence-aligned bitext...

\subsection{Multilingual Evidence for CL-WSD}

One of the most interesting CL-WSD systems of recent years, which inspired our
use of multilingual evidence in Chipa, is ParaSense
\cite{lefever-hoste-decock:2011:ACL-HLT2011},
developed by Els Lefever and colleagues.

ParaSense uses memory-based learning to predict target-language translations
of individual source-language words. It starts with features that one would
expect for a text classification problem: the surface forms, POS tags, and
lemmas for the focus word and the tokens in a small window around it, as well
as some syntactic information from a chunk parser. But ParaSense then adds
bag-of-words features for translations of the input sentence into languages
\emph{other} than the target language. ParaSense handles translation from
English into French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch and German, so for example when
translating from English to French, it would include bag-of-words features
extracted from the translations of the English sentence into Spanish, Italian,
Dutch and German.  

Given corpora that are parallel over many languages, such as Europarl, this is
straightforward at training time.
However, at testing time it requires a complete MT system for each of the four
other languages, which seems computationally prohibitive.

This is done by building artificial parallel corpora in several languages, on
demand, with the Google Translate API.


In the past, ParaSense has simply called out to the Google Translate API to
generate the bag-of-words features required for test sentences.

This seems unwieldy, and thus in our work, we learn from several parallel
corpora but require neither a locally running MT system nor access to an online
translation API.

They outperform the previous state-of-the art systems on the SemEval 2010
shared task 13 \cite{lefever-hoste-decock:2011:ACL-HLT2011}.
This work has not yet, to our knowledge, been integrated into an MT system
on its own.


In our earlier work, we prototyped a system that addresses some of the issues
with ParaSense, requiring more modest software infrastructure for feature
extraction while still allowing CL-WSD systems to make use of several mutually
parallel bitexts that share a source language
\cite{rudnick-liu-gasser:2013:SemEval-2013}.


\section{WSD with sequence models}
To our knowledge, there has not been other work on framing CL-WSD for all words
in an input sentence as a sequence labeling problem.
%% XXX: in some sense, isn't an MT system with a LM just a richer model for
%% this, with different possible segmentations and reordering?


However, in monolingual WSD, Molina \textit{et al.}
\cite{DBLP:conf/iberamia/MolinaPS02} have made use of HMMs for WSD. 

To our knowledge, there has not been work specifically on sequence labeling
applied to lexical selection for RBMT systems.

Outside of the CL-WSD setting, there has been work on framing all-words WSD as
a sequence labeling problem. Particularly, Molina \textit{et al.}
\cite{DBLP:conf/iberamia/MolinaPS02} have made use of HMMs for all-words
WSD in a monolingual setting.

We have also done some previous work on CL-WSD for translating into indigenous
American languages; an earlier version of Chipa, for Spanish-Guarani, made use
of sequence models to jointly predict all of the translations for a sentence at
once \cite{rudnick-gasser:2013:HyTra}.

Look into the recent stuff from BabelNet and Babelfy: what are they doing
there?


\section{CL-WSD for Lexical Selection in RBMT}

The Apertium team has a particular practical interest in improving lexical
selection in RBMT; they recently have been developing
a new system, described in \cite{tyers-fst}, that learns finite-state
transducers for lexical selection from the available parallel corpora. It is
intended to be both very fast, for use in practical translation systems, and
to produce lexical selection rules that are understandable and modifiable by
humans.

Francis Tyers, in his dissertation work \cite{tyers-dissertation},
provides an overview of lexical selection systems and describes methods for
learning lexical selection rules based on available parallel corpora.
These rules make reference to the lexical items and parts of speech surrounding
the word to be translated. Once learned, these rules are intended to be
understandable and modifiable by human language experts. For practical use in
the Apertium machine translation system, they are compiled to finite-state
transducers.


\section{CL-WSD for PB-SMT}

%% everything about Carpuat and Wu goes here
More recently, Carpuat and Wu have
shown how to use classifiers to improve modern phrase-based SMT systems
\cite{carpuatpsd}.
More recently, Carpuat and Wu have
shown how to use word-sense disambiguation techniques to improve modern
phrase-based SMT systems \cite{carpuatpsd}, even though the language model and
phrase tables of these systems can mitigate the problem of lexical ambiguities
somewhat.

While most SMT systems do not make use of an explicit WSD module, recently
there has been work on adding WSD classifiers in to statistical MT systems.
Particularly, Carpuat and Wu have shown how to use CL-WSD, or more broadly,
cross-lingual phrase sense disambiguation, to improve modern phrase-based SMT
systems
\cite{carpuatpsd,carpuat-wu:2007:EMNLP-CoNLL2007,carpuat2008evaluation}. In
Carpuat's work, classifiers are used to label multi-word expressions (phrases,
in the phrase-based SMT sense) with target language phrases. She demonstrates
how this is more appropriate in an an SMT setting than simply labeling
individual words with WordNet synsets, as had previously been attempted, and
showed significant improvements on a Chinese-English translation task.

Before the work of Carpuat and Wu~\cite{improvingsmtwsd}, it was apparently
unclear whether WSD was necessary or helpful for a state-of-the-art statistical
MT system; lexical choice among possible translations for a given word can
often be handled by the language model for the target language, simply due to
collocations of appropriate words in the training data.


%% Brown et al
Framing the resolution of lexical ambiguities in machine translation
as an explicit classification
task has a long history, dating back at least to early SMT work at IBM
\cite{Brown91word-sensedisambiguation}.

An early paper by IBM researchers \cite{Brown91word-sensedisambiguation},
outlines the CLWSD task in a strikingly similar way, as a WSD task where the
possible senses of a word are extracted from statistical alignments learned
over a bitext corpus. Brown \textit{et al.} report significant translation
quality improvements through the use of their WSD system, over a small
hand-evaluated set of test sentences.





There has also been work on using discriminative MaxEnt models to adapt
the ``forward" translation model of an SMT system, using richer
source-language context features \cite{vzabokrtsky-popel-marevcek:2010:WMT}.
While it has much the same effect, this work does not describe itself in terms
of word sense disambiguation.




\section{WSD for lower-resourced languages}
However, there has been work recently on using WSD techniques for translation
into lower-resourced languages, such as the English-Slovene language pair, as
in \cite{vintar-fivser-vrvsvcaj:2012:ESIRMT-HyTra2012}. 

Dinu and KÃ¼bler~\cite{Dinu07} have addressed the problem of monolingual WSD for
a lower-resourced language, particularly Romanian. In their work, they describe
an instance-based approach in which a relatively small number of features is
used quite effectively. In other work on lower-resourced languages,
Sarrafzdadeh \textit{et al.} have investigated a version of the Lesk algorithm
for Farsi \cite{sarrafzdadeh}.

Although they did not present a complete MT system, there has also been work
on using WSD techniques for translation into lower-resourced languages, such as
the English-Slovene language pair, as in
the work of \v{S}pela \emph{et al.}
\cite{vintar-fivser-vrvsvcaj:2012:ESIRMT-HyTra2012}. 

%% XXX
One sort of interesting point here is that we are not doing WSD on a
low-resourced language. This is ultimately WSD on Spanish with a sense
inventory that we automatically discover from cross-lingual evidence.


\section{CL-WSD at SemEval}
CL-WSD has received enough attention to warrant shared tasks at recent SemEval
workshops; the most recent running of the task is described by Lefever and
Hoste \cite{task10}.

Similar was the earlier task: \cite{lefever-hoste:2009:SEW}

There was also the Writing Assistant task (XXX cite Maarten), which is related
but not quite the same.

In the two CL-WSD tasks, participants were asked to translate twenty different
polysemous English nouns into five different European languages, in a variety
of contexts.

Some of the approaches explored included...



\section{Translation into Morphologically Rich Languages}
In Section \ref{sec:terere}, we are attempting to build a complete MT system
for the Spanish-Guarani language pair. As Guarani has a very rich morphology,
which we will need to predict and synthesize. As such, here we will quickly
review some of the work on morphological prediction and generation for
statistical MT systems.

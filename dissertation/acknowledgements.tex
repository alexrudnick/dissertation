%% I'd like to thank the academy, but I cannot in good conscience.

A doctoral thesis is a heck of a thing, and I could not have done it without
the help of a great number of people, some of whom I would like to acknowledge
here.

I'd first like to thank Lindsey Kuper, my lovely wife, for putting up with me
[in general, but especially]
throughout our tenure in graduate school. We're out of the cold now.

I'd like to thank my wonderful parents, Lenoir and Jim, for their continued
love, encouragement and confidence, and their sympathy and advice during the
rougher times.

I'd like to thank the Google Atlanta diaspora, especially Joel Webber and Bruce
Johnson, for helping me get a foot in the door at one of the world's great
machine learning and NLP companies. You did so much for my confidence and
drive, and you sent me off to graduate school with a spring in my step and a
chip on my shoulder. I hope you realize how much it's meant to me.

I'd like to thank the Bloomington Area Runners Association, especially Katie,
Andrew, Zach, Cliff, Mike, Sara, Sarah, and Ben \& Steph, for your friendship
and camaraderie, keeping me relatively healthy and relatively happy during my
time in Bloomington.

And I'd like to thank my committee for their encouragement, support, warmth,
skepticism, feedback, and patience.

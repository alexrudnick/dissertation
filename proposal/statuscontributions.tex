\section{Status and Expected Contributions}

Thus far, we have prototyped our CL-WSD systems that make use of multilingual
evidence and sequence labeling techniques and seen promising initial results
with these approaches, as described in \S\ref{sec:clwsd} and our papers
mentioned in that section.

Initial experiments are underway with building Terer√© on top of the cdec
toolkit; we can already train Guarani-language LMs with KenLM
\cite{Heafield-estimate}, trained on the Guarani-language Wikipedia.
Additionally, we have mocked up the inclusion of CL-WSD features into the
decoder and started experimenting with writing SCFG transfer rules.

The Tahekami website is already well underway, and we have a web server on
which we can run Tahekami and Guampa. Fairly enthusiastic volunteers, including
developers from Paraguay, will likely continue helping in their development.

As a result of this work, we will have developed some new approaches for
CL-WSD and for building translation systems that target lower-resourced
languages. In this setting, phrase-based SMT is not feasible, so we have to
make effective use of our resources for the source language.
Practically, we should also have a new MT system for the Spanish-Guarani
language pair where there was previously none, an open-source reusable
package for helping RBMT systems make appropriate lexical choices, and a freely
available bitext corpus for a resource-poor language.

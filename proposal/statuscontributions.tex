\section{Status and Expected Contributions}
In this dissertation, I will investigate practical, relatively inexpensive ways
to build hybrid machine translation systems through the application of CL-WSD
techniques and by engaging with a disadvantaged language's activist community
to effectively crowdsource the construction of larger bitext corpora. As a
result, we will deploy an MT system for the co-official languages of Paraguay
and help Guarani speakers develop a repository of educational materials for
their language.

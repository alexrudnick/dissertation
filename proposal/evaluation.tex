\section{Evaluation}

Seriously need to think and write about evaluation here.

Things we could do include:

\begin{itemize}
\item winning at the SemEval CL-WSD shared task
\item constructing more held-out test sets
\item BLEU scores
\item more thorough, formal version of the evaluation from the HyTra paper
\item human evaluations
\end{itemize}

\section{Paraguay and the Guarani Language}
Guarani is unique among indigenous American languages in that a substantial
number of non-indigenous people speak it.  The majority of Paraguayans are
conversant in Guarani, although they are likely to be bilingual with Spanish.
In practice, many Paraguayans use a combination of Guarani and Spanish called
\emph{Jopar{\'a}}.

We have made contact with a number of collaborators in Paraguay, including
language activists and educators from the \emph{Ateneo de la Lengua y Cultura
Guaraní} and the \emph{Fundación Yvy Marãe'{\~y}}, schools that offer training
for Guarani-language translators. We have also started discussing development
plans with several local software developers interested in building open source
software.

| notes from Mike on proposals |
--------------------------------
(5 July)

First, you should present the topic in the form of explicit Research
Questions (in fact just about every PhD proposal I've ever seen except this
one does that, as far as I can remember over the roughly 30-50 that I've
read; maybe the culture is different in PL?). The advantage of questions to
be answered is that it's easier to say when you're done: you're done when
you've answered each of the questions!

Second, there's not much related work here; you would have more, I think
(WSD, CL-WSD, MT for under-resourced languages, etc.).

Third, the "Status" section in your case would also be much longer, I
assume. That would then lead to what's left to be done.

(late August)
I looked back for examples and couldn't find many. First wondered what I'd done
with them, then realized that we used to only get paper versions from most
students. Anyway I'm attaching some examples that I think are pretty good to
show the variety. ONE's is definitely longer than yours needs to be (TWO's
too), and he kind of hides the research question (at the beginning of section
5). I like the way THREE and TWO start with a Statement of the Problem section,
ending that with the Research Questions, then use the questions to help
organize the description of the project.  They slip related work in Statement
of the Problem without a separate Related Work section, though that's another
way to go. None of them has an explicit Thesis Statement.

FWIW, THREE and TWO went on to write great dissertations; ONE abandoned his
years ago.

A proposed schedule is helpful, if you can do it. It's in two of these
examples.

Hope this helps. Basically there are a lot of perfectly acceptable ways to
organize things, and I don't have really strong preferences.

| notes from Mike on Andy's proposal |
--------------------------------------
(5 July)

First, you should present the topic in the form of explicit Research
Questions (in fact just about every PhD proposal I've ever seen except this
one does that, as far as I can remember over the roughly 30-50 that I've
read; maybe the culture is different in PL?). The advantage of questions to
be answered is that it's easier to say when you're done: you're done when
you've answered each of the questions!

Second, there's not much related work here; you would have more, I think
(WSD, CL-WSD, MT for under-resourced languages, etc.).

Third, the "Status" section in your case would also be much longer, I
assume. That would then lead to what's left to be done.

\section{Cross-lingual Word Sense Disambiguation}

Cross-lingual word sense disambiguation (CL-WSD) is the task of labeling words
or phrases in some input text with their contextually-appropriate translations
into some target language.
It is a variant of the more general WSD task, with the sense inventory for each
word defined as its possible translations.
This setting for WSD has immediate applications in both machine translation and
cross-language information retrieval, since many words have multiple possible
translations.

WSD in translation has a long history; practical work in integrating
WSD with statistical machine translation dates back to early SMT work at IBM
\cite{Brown91word-sensedisambiguation}, but the problem itself was described in
Warren Weaver's prescient 1949 memorandum \cite{weavermemo}, which describes an
essentially modern conception of word sense disambiguation.

In the early history of machine translation, researchers were very concerned
with WSD; to some, it seemed an insurmountable problem. As Bar-Hillel wrote,
discussing the possibility of writing a program to translate sentences with
simple ambiguities like \emph{The box was in the pen.} \cite{barhillel1960}:

\begin{quote}
... I know of no program that would enable a machine to come up with this
unique rendering unless by a completely arbitrary and ad hoc procedure whose
futility would show itself ...
\end{quote}

To produce a correct rendering of this sentence in Spanish, for example, the
translation system must decide between translating ``pen" as \emph{corral} (an
enclosure, like for an animal) or as \emph{pluma} (the instrument for writing).
As of this writing, for this particular example, Google Translate picks the
less-sensible ``in the writing implement" translation (see Figure
\ref{fig:box-in-pen}).
One wonders how this could come about -- we would hope that the n-gram language
model for Spanish would prefer sentences about things in enclosures than things
in writing implements.
But the word \emph{en} can be a translation of either the English ``in" or
``on", and \emph{pluma} can also mean ``feather".
The situation is fairly complex.


\begin{figure}

  removing the final period in the English sentence causes a switch between the
  ``pluma" and ``corral" renderings.}
  \label{fig:box-in-pen}
\end{figure}

In general, there is a many-to-many relationship between words across language
boundaries.
This happens for a number of reasons: figurative or metaphorical uses may not
translate directly,
obligatory information in one language may be left unspecified in another,
or the criteria for selecting a word may simply be differ.
To give some familiar examples, a ``leg" of a trip in English is typically
translated as \emph{etape} in French, which is unrelated to biological legs;
translating ``brother" to Japanese requires specifying whether the brother is
older (\emph{ani}) or younger (\emph{ot\=oto});
a soap bubble or a ceramic plate can be destroyed with the same word in
Chinese, whereas English speakers typically distinguish between the verbs
``pop" and ``break" \cite{majid2007semantic}.

Despite these difficulties, most statistical MT systems do not use an explicit
WSD module \cite{wsdchap3}; the language model and phrase tables of these
systems mitigate lexical ambiguities by encouraging words used collocationally
to appear together in the output. Entire phrases\footnote{Not necessarily
``phrases" in a syntactic sense, but subsequences of sentences} such as verbs
with their common objects may be learned and stored in the phrase table, and
the language model will encourage common collocations as well.

To take a look at some apparently easier examples, let us also consider the
following usages of \emph{letter}, from the test set of a recent SemEval shared
task \cite{task10}, and how to translate them into Spanish.

\enumsentence{
But a quick look at today's \emph{letters} to the editor in the Times suggest
that here at least is one department of the paper that could use a little more
fact-checking. }
\label{sent:carta}
\enumsentence{
All over the ice were little Cohens, little Levys, their names sewed in block
\emph{letters} on the backs of their jerseys. }
\label{sent:letra}

We would want (\ref{sent:carta}) to be translated with the word \emph{carta},
and (\ref{sent:letra}) to be translated with ``letra" or something similar.
Google Translate (as of this writing) handles both of these sentences well,
rendering the first with ``cartas" and the second with an even better choice,
translating the phrase ``block letters" as \emph{may√∫sculas}.
However longer-distance relationships, search errors, or simple statistical
accidents can still cause strange translations in practice.

Despite the great success of SMT systems without any explicit models for WSD,
there has been recent interest in CL-WSD and its application to translation
systems, sparking shared tasks at recent SemEval workshops
\cite{lefever-hoste:2010:SemEval,task10} and a number of other projects
described in some detail in \S\ref{sec:relatedwork}).

In this dissertation, we will describe in detail some new approaches for CL-WSD
and how to integrate them into a practical machine translation system.
We will develop and extend at least two broad approaches for CL-WSD: the use of
multilingual evidence where available, and CL-WSD as a sequence labeling
problem.
Both of these techniques have been prototyped and presented at workshops, but
they will be refined significantly and packaged into more general tools for use
in MT.

  and French words. Figure 21.2 from \protect\cite{slp1}; example originally

\subsection{Using multilingual evidence}
For some languages, such as English, Spanish, and the other languages of the
European Union, we have multiple bitext corpora available, covering several
different language pairs with the same source language.
We would like to be able to make use of evidence from all of these corpora when
translating into any particular target language, if possible.
Each corpus may contain useful examples of a given source-language word,
and senses of that word may be lexicalized in varying, non-overlapping ways in
the different target languages.

We want a CL-WSD system to be able to learn the relationships between the
senses of a given source word that are lexicalized in varying ways in the
various other languages. Two target languages may happen to surface the same
sense distinctions, perhaps due to being related languages, or simply
by coincidence. Alternatively, a combination of translations into several
languages may provide evidence for a certain lexical choice in the target
language of interest.

Earlier this year, we developed a prototype CL-WSD system that makes use of
multilingual evidence \cite{rudnick-liu-gasser:2013:SemEval-2013} and produced
some of the best results in a SemEval shared task on CL-WSD \cite{task10}.
Concretely, teams undertaking the task had to translate polysemous nouns from
English into other European languages.
In our SemEval paper, we presented three variations on the approach:
a straightforward classification approach (without multilingual evidence), a
classifier stacking approach, and a graphical model system based on loopy
belief propagation over Markov networks.

The simplest system presented in that work, based on a maximum entropy
classifier, simply extracted features from a window around the English noun to
be translated and used these to make a prediction. The same system could also
return a probability distribution over target-language words or phrases. This
simple system was used as a subcomponent in the two more sophisticated systems.

The classifier stacking approach uses
... %% XXX
for each available bitext corpus, for each source-language word that we want to
model, we train a classifier to predict translations from the source language
into the other language of the bitext.
Then we can include the output of that classifier as a feature when training
our classifier for the desired target language.


In the graphical model approach, we treat the problem of 
... this also has the property of explicitly handling the uncertainty of each
of the component classifiers.


We could also imagine using a sense-annotated corpus to train a ``monolingual"
WSD system, and use this as a 
... basically ensemble methods for WSD.
\cite{brown1992class}

This approach is informed by the work of Lefever and Hoste
\cite{lefever-hoste-decock:2011:ACL-HLT2011}, although their technique requires
an entire machine translation system to perform CL-WSD, which is somewhat
unwieldy when we want to use CL-WSD as a subcomponent of a machine translation
system.


\subsection{Lexical selection as a sequence labeling problem}
We will also investigate the use of sequence labeling models for lexical
selection.  The intuition behind the sequence labeling approach is that machine
translation implies an ``all-words" WSD task, in that we need to choose a
translation for every word or phrase in the source sentence, and that the
sequence of translations chosen should make sense when taken together.


One promising formalism for this line of work is the Maximum Entropy Markov
Model \cite{icml00/mccallum}, which can be combined in a straightforward way
with the simpler Hidden Markov Model (HMM).
This combination allows for efficient inference and the ability to trade more
computational resources for richer modeling. More sophisticated sequence
models, such as Conditional Random Fields, may be useful in this task as well.

We also developed a prototype CL-WSD system based on sequence labeling and
applied it to both English-Spanish and Spanish-Guarani translation tasks; this
work was presented at the HyTra workshop in August
\cite{rudnick-gasser:2013:HyTra-2013}.

For the sequence labeling approach in which only some words have their
translations modeled explicitly with a classifier, we have yet to explore what
the best approaches are for choosing \emph{which} words should get classifiers.

We will also look into the best ways to integrate the multilingual approach
with this one.

TODO look at the papers Nathan sent and be able to explain what other people
are doing for hard sequence labeling problems. That might go in the related
work section, or perhaps here.

\subsection{CL-WSD system combination}

Think about and expand the conversation I had with Markus.

You could imagine different CL-WSD systems rating each option separately and
then using MERT to get like an ensemble.
The question we were trying to address is like:
what if your n-gram model over labels for your source language has one idea
(this is the next likely label), and your emission probabilities say something
else (this is the label most likely to generate the observed input word)...
well, we could imagine just making several different decisions and letting the
decoder sort it out. We're doing that already actually, by including
phrase-table probabilities and a language model.
Are we just converging on the idea of a log-linear model again?
But the point here is that we don't have to have just one CL-WSD system. We can
have a bunch and let them fight it out. Hopefully this will help!

\subsection{Applying similar techniques for morphology prediction}

Sequence labeling has also been applied to the problem of generating
morphological features in target language text, so that target language output
words are appropriately inflected...
\cite{toutanova-suzuki-ruopp:2008:ACLMain}

This will be one of the approaches we investigate in the development of
Terer√©...
